# British Airways Premium vs. Standard AMEX Credit Card Analysis

## Analysis begins by assuming a £0.01 per avios

### Above we can see that in order for the Premium card to offer additional value and not cost, one has to spend ~>4K GBP p/m. 
### Below, I carry out the same optimisation as above and I bootstrap the avg. personal monthly GBP spend requirement for an array of AVIOS fair values.


### i.e.
If someone spends £2000 p/m using his AMEX, then in order to breakeven on the premium card vs. the standard, you would have to book trips with AVIOS that utilised a minimum of 2c (£0.02) per AVIOS.

# Conclusion
[AMEX Premium vs. Standard](https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/benefits/upgrade/ba-premium-plus-credit-card/)
1. All other benefits being equal, it seems that the standard card will be more beneficial in isolation. This means that if no other benefits are used in a given year and only AVIOS are utilised, then AMEX Standard seems to outperform AMEX Premium given that the [avg. Avios cash values are between 0.8c (£0.008) - 1.9c (£0.019)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/avios-points-value)
